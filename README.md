### 🪨 Stone, Paper, Scissors Game 📝✂️

**Welcome to the ultimate showdown of chance and strategy (but mostly chance)!** 🎲

This is not just your ordinary Rock, Paper, Scissors game—this is *Stone, Paper, Scissors* coded by yours truly, where you get to test your wits against a random number generator that has no emotions, no fear, and definitely no mercy.

### What’s Inside? 🔍

- **JavaScript Concepts Galore**: I’ve used everything from functions to loops to give this game some real character (even if it’s just a bunch of if-else statements pretending to be intelligent).
- **`getRandom()`**: A function that makes the computer's choice as unpredictable as my study habits.
- **`permission()`**: Because consent is important, even in coding—this function ensures you’re ready before the game starts (because let’s face it, you need a moment to prepare for the inevitable defeat).
- **`Instructions()`**: For those who are new to the ancient art of Stone, Paper, Scissors, this function provides a quick rundown so you can lose with dignity.
- **`prompt-sync`**: We’re using this nifty module to take user input because, let’s be honest, how else would you play this masterpiece?

### How It Works 🚀

1. **Install Dependencies**: Before you get started, make sure to run `npm install prompt-sync` in your terminal to set up the necessary package. This ensures you can actually interact with the game—because what's a game without user input?
2. **Start the Game**: Just say "yes" (or any variation of it that JavaScript can recognize) and you're in! If you’re not ready, don’t worry—the game will politely insist until you change your mind.
3. **Make Your Choice**: Choose ‘S’ for Stone, ‘P’ for Paper, or ‘K’ for Scissors. But beware—my random number generator has been trained by the best (just kidding, it’s completely random).
4. **Scoreboard**: The game keeps track of points, so you know exactly how badly you’re losing—or winning, if luck’s on your side.
5. **Witty Endings**: Whether you win, lose, or tie, you’ll be treated to a snarky comment at the end, because who doesn’t love a good laugh with their victory or defeat?

### Final Words 🎤

This is a project that combines the thrill of classic games with the frustration of losing to a computer that has no idea what it's doing. It’s a fun way to practice your JavaScript skills, or just to pass the time when you’re bored and feel like pretending to be productive.

So go ahead, clone the repo, run `npm install prompt-sync`, and see if you can outsmart my code. But be warned—you might just end up shouting "looooooooserrrrrrrrr!" at your screen!
